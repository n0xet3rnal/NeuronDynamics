# NeuronDynamics
A collection of Jupyter Notebooks that simulate neuronal dynamics using three classic models: the Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) model, the FitzHugh-Nagumo model, and a model based on Hopf oscillators. These simulations provide insights into neural excitability, spiking patterns, and oscillatory behaviors commonly observed in biological neural systems.
