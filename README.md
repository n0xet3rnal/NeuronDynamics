# NeuronDynamics

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks that simulate neuronal dynamics using three different models: the **Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) model**, the **FitzHugh-Nagumo model**, and the **Hopf oscillator-based model**. Each model captures distinct aspects of neuron excitability and signal transmission.

## Model Descriptions

### 1. Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) Model
**File:** `HH_Model.ipynb`  
The Hodgkin-Huxley model provides a detailed biophysical representation of neuron activity, modeling the generation and propagation of action potentials based on ion channel dynamics.

**Functionalities included in the code:**
- Implementation of the Hodgkin-Huxley equations for ion channel gating.
- Simulation of action potential generation in response to external stimuli.
- Visualization of membrane potential changes and ionic currents over time.
- Exploration of different stimulation currents and their impact on neuron firing.

### 2. FitzHugh-Nagumo Model
**File:** `FitzhughNagumo.ipynb`  
The FitzHugh-Nagumo model is a simplified, two-variable abstraction of the Hodgkin-Huxley model that captures essential neuron excitability dynamics while reducing computational complexity.

**Functionalities included in the code:**
- Numerical simulation of neuron excitability and relaxation oscillations.
- Phase plane analysis to visualize system trajectories and stability.
- Parameter tuning to observe changes in neuron response characteristics.
- Interactive visualizations to better understand excitability dynamics.

### 3. Hopf Oscillator-Based Model
**File:** `HopfModel.ipynb`  
The Hopf oscillator-based model is a dynamical systems approach to neuronal oscillations, capturing rhythmic activity and bifurcations using limit cycles.

**Functionalities included in the code:**
- Implementation of Hopf bifurcation equations to model oscillatory dynamics.
- Stability analysis of equilibrium points and transitions to limit cycles.
- Visualization of phase portraits and time-series behavior.
- Exploration of different parameter regimes to analyze bifurcations.
